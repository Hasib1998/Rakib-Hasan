            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p> The Honors Program in Economics gives outstanding senior majors an opportunity to design and carry out a
                research project on a topic of their choice, under close supervision of faculty. Students who are
                interested
                in
                pursuing honors in economics should apply during their junior year. The research project culminates in a
                senior
                thesis which, together with the student's record in economics courses, forms the basis for faculty
                decisions
                on
                the award of departmental honors.

                The program is administered by the Department's Committee on Undergraduate Honors and Awards. The
                Committee
                consists of the Director of Undergraduate Studies and two faculty appointed by the Chair of the
                Department.
                (The
                faculty member directing the Senior Seminar, Economics 398, is not eligible to serve on the Committee.)
                The
                Director of Undergraduate Studies serves as the departmental honors coordinator.

            <h2>Shelter-in-Place Policies and Excess Mortality</h2>
            <p>Shelter-in-place policies were one of the most widely used policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.
                Many countries, and most US states, adopted such policies for at least some time. The policies varied in
                their stringency and duration. How did all-cause excess mortality evolve after these policies were
                adopted? In a new research paper (28930), NBER Research Associate Neeraj Sood of the University of
                Southern California (USC), Virat Agrawal of USC, and Jonathan H. Cantor and Christopher M. Whaley of the
                RAND Corporation compile data on mortality patterns before and after the implementation of the
                shelter-in-place policies. They find that despite the expectation that these policies would reduce
                mortality, in most places mortality increased modestly after their adoption. The researchers offer
                several potential explanations for this finding, including changes in the use of medical care for
                non-COVID-19 conditions, changes in the transmissibility or virulence of the COVID-19 virus after
                shelter-in-place policies took effect, and the effects of social isolation. Sood describes their
                findings in the video below. An archive of NBER videos on pandemic-related research may be found here.



                Three NBER working papers distributed this week report on economic, health, and related consequences of
                the COVID-19 pandemic, or on the impact of public policies that respond to it. One documents the
                pandemic-related increase in excess mortality for various groups, finding the largest increase for
                Hispanics, and a larger increase for Blacks than for Whites (28958). Another explores ways that private
                insurers could provide protection against the financial consequences of future pandemics (28968).
                Another studies the relationship between the implied skewness of interest rates associated with Treasury
                bond options, and future movements in Treasury yields, during the pandemic and in other periods (28954).

                More than 425 NBER working papers have addressed various aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These papers
                are open access and have been collected for easy reference. Like all NBER papers, they are circulated
                for discussion and comment, and have not been peer-reviewed. View them in reverse chronological order or
                by topic area.

                Firms’ Inflation Expectations Show Little Evidence of Anchoring
                Survey data suggest that most CEOs are unaware of the current rate of inflation and of the Fed’s
                inflation goals and that their inflation expectations differ from those of households and professional
                forecasters. Firms’ price- and wage-setting decisions are based, in part, on their expectations of
                future inflation. These decisions in turn shape future inflation outcomes. While firms’ inflation
                expectations can therefore be important determinants of optimal...

                The Productivity, Innovation, and Entrepreneurship (PIE) Program was founded as the Productivity
                Program, with Zvi Griliches as the inaugural program director, in 1978. The program benefited
                tremendously from Griliches’ inspirational leadership, which was continued by Ernst Berndt. In recent
                years, the program has expanded to incorporate the vibrant and growing body of research in the
                affiliated fields of innovation and entrepreneurship. With the generous support of the...

                School Reopenings Contribute to Modest, but Heterogeneous, Rise in COVID-19 Transmission
                Uncertainty about the risk of COVID-19 transmission from school reopenings has confounded educational
                decision-making during the pandemic. Research on this topic has been affected by research design
                complications and a lack of data. In Back to School: The Effect of School Visits during COVID-19 on
                COVID-19 Transmission (NBER Working Paper 28645), researchers Dena Bravata, Jonathan H. Cantor, Neeraj

                Benjamin Jones, Heidi Williams to Lead Innovation Policy Working Group
                joneandwilliams_2up_2.jpg

                Benjamin Jones and Heidi Williams are the new codirectors of the NBER Innovation Policy Working Group.
                Jones is the Gordon and Llura Gund Family Professor in Entrepreneurship and Professor of Strategy at
                Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. Williams is the Charles R. Schwab Professor of
                Economics at Stanford University and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute of Economic Policy
                Research. They succeed Scott Stern, the David Sarnoff Professor of Management at MIT’s Sloan School of
                Management who, along with Adam Jaffe of Brandeis University and Josh Lerner of the Harvard Business
                School, launched the working group over two decades ago.

                The new codirectors have studied a wide range of issues in the field of innovation economics. Jones’
                research focuses on the contributions of innovation and scientific progress to economic growth. He has
                been an NBER affiliate since 2005. Williams’ research examines the determinants and consequences of
                technological change, with a particular emphasis on innovation in the healthcare sector. She has been
                NBER affiliate since 2010, and also is a codirector of the NBER Health Care Program.

                Why Do Disability Insurance Enrollments Rise during Recessions?
                The number of applications and new awards for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) rose during
                the Great Recession and earlier economic downturns. Some have speculated that this phenomenon could
                occur again during the COVID-19 crisis in the wake of pandemic-related job losses. While the
                relationship between economic conditions and SSDI awards is well-established, the reasons for it are
                less clear. One theory is that recessions worsen health, making more individuals...

                    of bank failures or near-failures, in many cases of what we now call shadow banks, and typically the
                    source of trouble was an excessive investment in real estate, Hugh Rockoff reports.</p>
