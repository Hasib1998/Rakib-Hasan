            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p> The Honors Program in Economics gives outstanding senior majors an opportunity to design and carry out a
                research project on a topic of their choice, under close supervision of faculty. Students who are
                interested
                in
                pursuing honors in economics should apply during their junior year. The research project culminates in a
                senior
                thesis which, together with the student's record in economics courses, forms the basis for faculty
                decisions
                on
                the award of departmental honors.

                The program is administered by the Department's Committee on Undergraduate Honors and Awards. The
                Committee
                consists of the Director of Undergraduate Studies and two faculty appointed by the Chair of the
                Department.
                (The
                faculty member directing the Senior Seminar, Economics 398, is not eligible to serve on the Committee.)
                The
                Director of Undergraduate Studies serves as the departmental honors coordinator.
